# Atria

## Install from source

Atria is written in [Julia Language](https://julialang.org/) v1.8.2. **Please use the exact version of Julia.**

### OSX

#### Prerequisite

OSX 10.8 or higher, 64-bit system.

##### Julia

Please download Julia using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), and then you can access to `julia` in terminal without other settings.

After you have Homebrew installed, in your terminal, run

```bash
brew cask install julia
```

> Or download a 64-bit `Julia-<version>.dmg` file from <https://julialang.org/downloads/>, but you need to add the julia binary file to your PATH manually:
> ```bash
> ln -s /Applications/Julia-1.8.app/Contents/Resources/julia/bin/julia /usr/local/bin
> ```

##### Pigz and Pbzip2

Pigz and Pbzip2 are parallel Gzip/Bzip2 commandline tools required in Atria. You can install with Homebrew:

```bash
brew install pigz
brew install pbzip2
```

##### Atria

Download the Atria git repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cihga39871/Atria.git
```

Go to `atria` directory, and run `build_atria.jl` with Julia:

```bash
cd atria
julia build_atria.jl
```

After installation, Atria is available at `./app-*/bin/atria`.  Link `atria` to one of your PATH:

```bash
sudo ln -s ./app-*/bin/atria /usr/local/bin
```

Linux, 64-bit system.

Please download Julia v1.8 from the [website](https://julialang.org/downloads/), and symlink `julia` binary file to your PATH.

Then, download `pigz` and `pbzip2` (a compression/decompression software used in Atria).

If you use Ubuntu/Debian, try `sudo apt install pigz pbzip2`. You can also download them from [pigz's official site](https://zlib.net/pigz/) and [pbzip2's official site](http://compression.ca/pbzip2/).
