# Atria

## Install from source

Atria is tested in [Julia Language](https://julialang.org/) v1.8 and v1.9. 

It is recommended to build Atria using Julia v1.8.5 because it is 3-20% faster than v1.9.

### Mac OS

#### Prerequisite

Mac OS 10.8 or higher, 64-bit system.

##### Julia

1. Download Julia package manager

```bash
curl -fsSL https://install.julialang.org | sh
```

2. Download and select Julia version v1.8.5. It is recommended to build Atria using Julia v1.8.5 because it is 3-20% faster than v1.9.

```bash
juliaup add 1.8
juliaup default 1.8
```

##### Pigz and Pbzip2

Pigz and Pbzip2 are parallel Gzip/Bzip2 commandline tools required in Atria. You can install with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```bash
brew install pigz
brew install pbzip2
```

> If you do not use Homebrew, you can also download them from [pigz's official site](https://zlib.net/pigz/) and [pbzip2](https://pkgs.org/download/pbzip2).


#### Atria

Download the Atria git repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cihga39871/Atria.git
```

Go to `Atria` directory, and run `build_atria.jl` with Julia:

```bash
cd Atria
julia build_atria.jl
```

After installation, Atria is available at `./app-*/bin/atria`.  Link `atria` to one of your PATH:

```bash
sudo ln -s ./app-*/bin/atria /usr/local/bin
```

### Linux

#### Prerequisite

Linux, 64-bit system.
