# Atria

## Release Installation Guide

Atria is written in [Julia Language](https://julialang.org/) v1.8 and works on 64-bit Linux and OSX systems.

The generic binaries do not require any special installation steps, but you will need to ensure that your system can find the `atria` executable, and `pigz` & `pbzip2` command for compression/decompression.

### Linux


#### Dependency

`pigz` and `pbzip2` are required.

If you use Ubuntu, try `sudo apt install pigz pbzip2`. You can also download them from [pigz's official site](https://zlib.net/pigz/) and [pbzip2's official site](http://compression.ca/pbzip2/).

#### Atria

First, extract the `.linux.tar.gz` file downloaded from the [release page](https://github.com/cihga39871/Atria/releases/) to a folder on your computer:

```bash
tar -zxf Atria-VERSION-linux.tar.gz
```

Atria is extracted to `Atria-VERSION` directory. To run Atria, you can do any of the following:

- Create a symbolic link to `atria` inside a folder which is on your system `PATH` (recommended)
- Add Atria's bin folder to your system `PATH` environment variable
- Invoke the `atria` executable by using its full path, as in `~/Atria/bin/atria`

For example, to create a symbolic link to `atria` inside the `/usr/local/bin` folder, you can do the following:

```bash
sudo ln -s <where_you_extracted_the_Atria_archive>/bin/atria /usr/local/bin/atria
```

### Mac OS

> Sorry, we no longer provide Atria release for Mac OS (x86 or M-series). Please [install Atria from source](./1.2.Install_from_source.md).

#### Dependency

`pigz` and `pbzip2` are required.

If you use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), try `brew install pigz; brew install pbzip2`. You can also download it from [pigz's official site](https://zlib.net/pigz/) and [pbzip2's official site](http://compression.ca/pbzip2/).

#### Atria

Sorry, we no longer provide Atria release for OSX (x86 or M-series). Please [install Atria from source](./1.2.Install_from_source.md).
